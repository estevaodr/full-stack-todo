/**
 * ToDo Component Styles
 * 
 * This file contains component-specific styles for the ToDo component.
 * Note: The main styling (using BEM methodology) is defined in the design system
 * at libs/client/ui-style/src/lib/scss/components/_todo.scss
 * 
 * This file can be used for:
 * - Component-specific overrides
 * - Scoped styles that shouldn't be part of the design system
 * - Temporary styles during development
 * 
 * For shared/reusable styles, add them to the design system instead.
 */

// Component-specific styles can go here
// The main styles are imported from the design system via styles.scss
