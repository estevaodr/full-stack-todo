/**
 * Vendors Directory - Third-Party Styles
 * 
 * This file imports external stylesheets and third-party CSS/SCSS libraries.
 * These are typically frameworks, resets, or utility libraries that provide
 * base styles before our custom styles are applied.
 * 
 * Imports:
 * - normalize.css: A modern CSS reset that makes browsers render elements
 *   more consistently and in line with modern standards. It's included first
 *   so our custom styles can override it as needed.
 * 
 * - nord: An open-source color palette providing muted, cool colors suitable
 *   for both light and dark modes. The Nord palette is well-regarded for its
 *   visual appeal and accessibility.
 * 
 * Note: The '~' prefix tells the bundler to resolve from node_modules
